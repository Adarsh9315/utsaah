                                Cancer affects everyone—regardless of age, gender, or background. It places a tremendous burden on patients, families, and society. As one of the leading causes of death worldwide, cancer brings emotional and financial challenges that can be overwhelming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Since 2015, <strong>Utsaah Foundation</strong> has been a beacon of hope for cancer patients, especially those at <strong>Tata Memorial Hospital</strong> and other institutions. We connect patients with vital resources, helping them navigate their treatment journey with dignity and support.
